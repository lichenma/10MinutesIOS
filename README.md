# 10Minutes IOS

Lightweight timer application developed to practice IOS development using Swift - based on the predecessor application 10Minutes developed in Kotlin. 

The general premise of this application is to help increase focus and moderate implusive internet surfing which we may be prone to. The 10 minute rule described in the Willpower Instinct details an exercise where if you want to do something, wait 10 minutes first and if you still want to do it then you can - the key is to wait first. This forces us to be conscious of what we want to do and helps increase concentration and productivity. 

The application once opened starts counting down immediately and constantly checks to make sure that the user does not exit the app (locking the screen is permitted but the app must not be backgrounded) until the ten minute counter is completed. Afterwards the user is free to leave the app and their streak is increased.
