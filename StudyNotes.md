# Introduction

This application is meant to be used as an introductory application to familiarize myself with the IOS development process. We start by building off a simple count down timer application built using Swift 3.0. 

## Timer Class 

One of the things we will be utilizing is the timer class provided by Apple API. Timer waits until a certain time interval has elapsed and then fires, sending a specified message to a target object. 

This timer class was created to make it easy to trigger actions like updating labels or firing methods at specific monments in time. 


## View Controller 

View controllers are used to managed the UIKit app's interface - a view controller manages a single root view which can contain many subviews. User interactions with the view hierarchy is handled with the view controller which coordinates with other objects of the app as needed.
